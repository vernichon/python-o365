'''
This script represents a way that O365 could be used to integrate parts of your enviorment. This is
not a theoretical example, this is a production script that I use at our facility. The objective
here is to aliviate a problem where the printer rests inside a protected network but students who
want to print are outside of that network. By sending print jobs they have to send it to an email address they
do not need to install the printer on their local device, nor do they need direct access to the
device.

The basic architecture of this script is as follows:
1. spin off as a server. If you don't have access to cron or cron is not working for you, this is a
    work around.
2. Global Exception Handling. Because we don't have cron to spin us backup, we need to catch any
    problem that mich crash the whole process.
3. Check for messages
4. Check that the sender is from our domain.
5. Create a username that is compatible with the printer (max 8 chars, no punctuation)
6. Verify attachment type
7. Download attachment
8. Send attachment to be printed
5-8: notify the user if there is problems or successes at any point in here.

Feel free to rework this to your enviorment. You'll want to change the verification method and the
printer.py file to match your needs.
