Run the script and you will be asked for username, password, reciving address,
subject, and then a body. When these have all come and gone your message will
be sent straight way. 

For attachments, include the path to the attachment in the call and the script
will attach the files or crash trying. (hopefully not the latter) 
e.g.: python simple-message.py that_file_you_want_but_could_only_ssh_in.jpg
